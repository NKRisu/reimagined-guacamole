## WeatherApp

So this is my weather app, created in a day. It takes user input for a city/municipality/town etc. Turns this information into coordinates, longitude, latitude and then uses that data to fetch weather information from the open-meteo's API.

Some minor tweaks were made to capitalize the first letter of user input as this input is used directly in some places on the website. Some neat logic to clear the graph a little bit to make it easier to read, such as showing the date change at midnight and only showing the day and month and not whole time information. Basic stuff to make everything look little bit more finetuned. 

### Used languages and libraries etc

JavaScript, Python, CSS, HTML, Deno, chart.js, flask, flask_cors, requests
